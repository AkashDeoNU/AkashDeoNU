- I'm Akash Deo :smiley:
- I'm a CS Major @ Northwestern University, and I'm interested in software engineering! :computer:
- Currently working as a research assistant in the programming languages department investigating whether various type-enforcement strategies in programming languages make it easier or more difficult for programmers to test their code. 🐛
- Also, I'm a software developer at ORCO, a startup that aims to make ✋ prosthetics cheaper and more flexible (literally) - and, I do a decent bit of work for NTech, a club at Northwestern. 
- I've also worked on some pretty neat games 🎮
- Project Lambda is a bullet hell game that I made
- Bowling Simulator is what it sounds like plus some cool power-ups 
- And, I made Minesweeper!
- Hope you had fun! 👋
